# wordpress-theme-dev-treehouse

This is a wordpress theme that I will be constructing from a static site that has been provided as part of the course materials for 'Wordpress Theme Development' as part of 'Development for Wordpress' on Treehouse.

The follow topics / skills have been covered:

- An overview of Wordpress theme development including a brief introduction to the Wordpress template hierarchy, setting up a WordPress theme folder and activating a wordpress theme

- Porting over CSS from a static template

- Adding CSS to a theme via the functions.php file

- how to link to JS from functions.php file

- Connecting the header.php and footer.php files using get_header() and get_footer()

- using wp_title() to ensure title is dynamically generated for each page; using wp_head() / wp_footer() to signify the end of the head / footer sections (so Wordpress knows where to put other items that it might need to add to the head or footer section); using blog_info('url') to grab the url of the site, also  blog_info('name') to grab the name of the site; 

- using the loop to generate page content:
    - Using the_title() and the_content() to generate the title and content within the loop
    - Other common loop functions reviewed
    
- making page templates and custom page templates
